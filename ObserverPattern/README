Oberver Pattern kind of one to many dependency between object so that wen one object change the state all its dependent are notified and updated automatically
1. the Observer pattern provided an object design where objects and observer are loosely coupled 
3. loosely coupled designs allows us to build flexible OO system that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between the objects.
