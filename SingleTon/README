Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instsnce and provides a global point of access to it.

Synchronize the createInstance Method:
    it will have performance impact becasue each time when we create try to create object synchronization will be called which is costly
Use eager Instantiation:
    we will alwyas going to instantiate as statically which is having no concern
Double Checking lock:
it is very good solution, no performance concern becayse sync will call only once
